# Current work

## Button geometry and radio group

### Plan

1. Completed: `.hb-button` keeps the border width of its view in the disabled state and makes the border transparent instead. Its outer dimensions now stay stable without changing the current button structure. The audit found no other state-dependent border-width changes: the existing controls only change border colour, while range thumb widths vary by size rather than state.
2. Completed: ported Gravity `SegmentedRadioGroup` as the public CSS block `hb-radio-group`: native `input[type="radio"]`, mutually exclusive options, selected, hover, disabled, and focus-visible states, size variants, documentation, generated demo, and `index.css` import. The compact icon-only example keeps accessible names on the radio inputs. Consumer integration is out of scope for this repository.
3. Completed: `v0.1.1` is tagged and pushed. Its GitHub Release title is `v0.1.1 — Stable disabled button geometry`. The future public `hb-radio-group` will require a subsequent `0.x` minor release; do not publish to npm unless requested.

### Definition of done

- A button keeps its measured width and height while its disabled state changes. Completed: outlined disabled buttons retain a transparent border.
- `hb-radio-group` is documented and usable as an independent CSS block with native radio semantics. Completed.
- The generated demos and release checks pass. Completed for the implementation; prepare `v0.2.0` locally without push.
