# Current work

## Button geometry and radio group

### Plan

1. Completed: `.hb-button` keeps the border width of its view in the disabled state and makes the border transparent instead. Its outer dimensions now stay stable without changing the current button structure. The audit found no other state-dependent border-width changes: the existing controls only change border colour, while range thumb widths vary by size rather than state.
2. Port Gravity `SegmentedRadioGroup` as the public CSS block `hb-radio-group`: native `input[type="radio"]`, mutually exclusive options, selected, hover, disabled, and focus-visible states, size variants, documentation, generated demo, and `index.css` import. The Selecta consumer will use the compact two-option variant with sun and moon symbols; accessible names stay on the radio inputs.
3. In progress: prepare the `v0.1.1` GitHub release. The future public `hb-radio-group` will require a subsequent `0.x` minor release; do not publish to npm unless requested.

### Definition of done

- A button keeps its measured width and height while its disabled state changes. Completed: outlined disabled buttons retain a transparent border.
- `hb-radio-group` is documented and usable as an independent CSS block with native radio semantics.
- The generated demos and release checks pass.
